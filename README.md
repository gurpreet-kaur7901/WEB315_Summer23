Well, I refresh the vscode and start making assignment2.
I add 2 new columns named as Price and Rating and by using migration command i add these in that.
Then, I add validations to my all properties, then after i read the instructions.
I add search bar and dropdown list in the Infos/Index. 
Then, i update the database.
I made branch in github named as Assignment2
And finally upload the code sucessfully.
