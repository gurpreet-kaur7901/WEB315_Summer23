*Todo App*
At first i refresh everthing and open vs code.
Run the commond for making the blazor app.
In the pages folder add todo page by run the appropriate command.
Edit the index page.
Add todo page in the NavMenu in the shared folder.
Add few elements in the todo page.
Set a button for add new item in the todo list.
Add filter tasks based on their status.
Add suitable controls.
Add styling in css.
Add error message that is "enter a todo".
After that i make a run, i faced few errors because of some spelling and general mistakes.
Took a break and then fix them. 
Again, run the program and it works.
